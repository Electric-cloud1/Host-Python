# KeyLogger + Current Process/Application Checker

<h3> NOTE: This is not meant to be used for Unethical Purposes or Wrong doings.

<h4>This is meant to Educate and for one to learn about Ethical hacking tools,cyber-security,scripting and etc. It is mainly  to help people get an idea about how to use Python to develop Ethical-Hacking and cyber-security tools (and be aware and gain knowledge) as it is the most commonly used Programming Language and Python is known as the best programming language for hacking and other fields such as Deep
learning â€“ and for really good reasons so.

Features:

<li>Keylogger (Able to run in the background)

<li>Gives the date and time of when the Keystroke Happened (Counts Action Keys too)

<li>Gives the Process ID value of the application/Program in which the Keystroke Happened in

<li>Generates A neat list of all the running processes at that time and their PID's in a separate File.

<h4>Enter your full path of the directory you want to generate the files
in (You can easily do this by just copying the Full path from file explorer if your using windows)
Do not give a \ Use / Instead

<h4> Enter the name of the file with no extensions for the log file (example: coding_project)
Hope you get a basic idea of how this Works and how this can be further improved to be used in the Industry Standard
for Cyber-Security, Ethical Hacking and etc.
