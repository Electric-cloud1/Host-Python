# Pyside2 File-Generator

This Function will be part of a GUI I'am making

<h4>Run the python file and give the full path of the directory you want to generate
the file in (You can easily do this by just copying the Full path from file explorer if your using windows)
Do not give a \ at the end for the Directory input

<h4> Enter the name of the file with no extensions (example: coding_project)
The program will automatically generate a python file for you which is fully editable and you can customize
it however you like it.
